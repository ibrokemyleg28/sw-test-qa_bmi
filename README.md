**To run this command line application, download the file(s) necessary from this repository (be sure to move the downloaded files into an empty folder on your desktop homescreen).**

**After you download these files, ensure you have 64-bit MinGW-w64 installed (or another C++ compiler for Windows command line) so you are able to run compiling commands for C++ such as 'g++' (this is how the application will be executed).**
*NOTE: You can test if the install was successful by pressing the Windows key + R, typing 'cmd' then enter, and--once the terminal pops up--type 'g++ --version', and it will give you the specifications if the install was successful.*

**Press the Windows key + R, type in 'cmd' when the box pops up and press enter, then type 'g++ -o bmi main.cpp bmi.cpp', then press enter. Then type '.\bmi' and press enter to run the application.**
*NOTE: You will most likely have to change the directory to the folder you put the files in on your Desktop before typing the 'g++' command. To do this, simply go to the File Explorer, find the folder you put the files into, left click to select then* right click *for options, then select "Copy as Path" near the middle of the pop-up menu. Finally, go back to the terminal, type 'cd ', then right click and select "Paste" to copy the correct path, and press enter. THEN type the 'g++' command.*
